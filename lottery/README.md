## Trustless Investment Smart Contract

LOTTERY investment Smart Contract was developed to secure investors' money. Investors send their ethers to the smart contract. After collecting all the investments, DGGV (DG Global Ventures) sends a transaction to transfer the funds to LOTTERY address (0x33efc5120d99a63bdf990013ecabbd6c900803ce) and transfer administration fees.

### Investment Insurance

The Smart Contract was specially developed to implement this logic and it doesn't allow any modification of the funds flow. In addition to this, DGGV has 7 days to send the transaction to send the funds to LOTTERY address. In the event that the transaction isn't generated during this period, the investors will be able to withdraw their investments.
