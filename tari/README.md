## Trustless Investment Smart Contract

TARI investment Smart Contract was developed to secure investors money. Investors will send their ethers to the smart contract. After collecting all the investments DGGV (DG Global Ventures) will send a transaction to send the funds to TARI address (0x33efc5120d99a63bdf990013ecabbd6c900803ce) and collect the fees.
The Smart Contract was specially developed to implement this logic and it doesn't allow any modification of the funds flow. DGGV has 7 days to send the invement transaction. In the event that the transaction isn't generated, the investors will be able to withdraw their investments.
